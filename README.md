# Challenge

Your challenge is to fork this repo to your repo, download it to your system and then write the code required to make the todo app functional. After the app is functional, push it to your repo and create a pull request to [my repo](https://github.com/yourgotocoder/mean-section-a).

## Forking this repo

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.

## Winning criteria

In case there are multiple pull requests with multiple working solutions, the first person who created a pull request will be declared the winner.
